# advent-of-code-2024

Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [markgravestock][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

In this repository, markgravestock is about to provide solutions for the puzzles using [Kotlin][kotlin] language.

### Notes

#### Day 6 Part 2

- Key insight: To detect a loop, you can check if you are ever at the same coordinate in the same direction when you hit an obstruction.
- TODO: Possibly you could detect at any coordinate you have visited if you are in the same direction and combine this with counting visited locations.

### Hints
